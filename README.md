# LinearRegression-Dataset-Advertising-Data-
In this project I have used Linear Regression Model for the prediction of Maximum Sales on Advertisement cost 
We hava Advertising data for that.
The data consists of 3 different feature variables and 1 Target variable.Target variables are mediums of advertisements and it has its cost 
and the sales(Target variable) generated on that. 
Using Linear regression we are trying to predict which medium of advertisement can generate the maximum sales for the company.
